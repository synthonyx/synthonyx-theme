## Brand Identity: "Revolutionizing Boring"
We are an engineer-driven infrastructure company. We are NOT a hype-driven Web3 startup.
- **Visuals:** "Braun Design" meets "Swiss Precision."
- **Colors:** Deep Purple (`#4A148C`), Charcoal (`#2C2C2C`), White (`#F5F5F5`). **NO gradients.**
- **Typography:**
  - Headings: **Montserrat** (Bold, Uppercase for Logo/Hero).
  - Body: **IBM Plex Sans** (Engineering readability).
  - Code: **JetBrains Mono**.

## Site Architecture (The IBM Model)
We operate a **Two-Domain Strategy** with a unified template:

### 1. synthonyx.group (Holding)
- **Audience:** Investors, Partners.
- **Vibe:** High-end family office, minimal, serious.
- **Content:** Portfolio (Synthonyx Technologies, Trrue DAT), Governance.

### 2. synthonyx.com (The Engine)
- **Audience:** Clients, Users, Developers.
- **Structure:**
  - `/products/`: For SaaS (Sovereign, BSOS). Target: Technical User.
  - `/services/`: For Consulting/Labs. Target: Executive Buyer.
  - `/academy/`: Educational content (DORA).
  - `/blog/`: Thought leadership.

## Tone of Voice
- **Direct:** No fluff. No corporate jargon.
- **Technical:** We respect the reader's intelligence.
- **Sovereign:** We emphasize European control, privacy, and engineering independence.
